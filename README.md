# HomeWork7-Apriorit

Just run main.
First example shows the work of guard that covers HANDLE. I recommend to change path if you get "The file can not be created or opened" exception several times.
The second example shows 3 different deleters for std::unique_ptr<SOCKET>
The third one shows my implementation of shared and weak pointers.
